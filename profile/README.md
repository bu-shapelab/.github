Welcome to the BU Shape Lab where computation meets creativity.
We investigate research problems in Computer Graphics and Computational Fabrication, with interests extending into Human Computer Interaction and Engineering Mechanics.
We are a [team](https://shape.bu.edu/team) of computer scientists, makers, and engineers, with a long list of inspirations from architectural design to sports technologies.
Take a look at our [publications](https://shape.bu.edu/publications) and [news](https://shape.bu.edu/news) to learn more.

The Shape Lab is directed by [Prof. Emily Whiting](http://cs-people.bu.edu/whiting/), and is associated with the [Computer Graphics Lab](https://sites.bu.edu/graphics/) and [Vision & Graphics Group](http://www.bu.edu/cs/research/vg/) in the [Computer Science Department](http://www.bu.edu/cs/) at Boston University.
